# Implementation Log

This file tracks the progress of the CPHO AI platform development. It serves as the "Blackboard" for multi-agent coordination.

## Current Epic: Agentic Harness Architecture
**Goal**: Establish the framework for multi-agent parallel development.

| ID | Task | Branch | Status | Owner | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ARCH-1 | Define Harness Doc | `feature/agentic-harness-architecture` | ✅ Done | Gemini | Created agentic-harness.md |

## History
- 2026-05-09: Initial setup of the Agentic Harness branch and documentation.

## Current Epic: Issue #10 AI Solver OpenRouter Gemini multimodal orchestration
**Target Branch**: `feature/openrouter-gemini-multimodal`
**Goal**: Implement server-side OpenRouter/Gemini multimodal AI Solver analysis with model-driven decomposition, fixed 7-section assembly, threaded follow-up Q&A, selected-text Q&A, and retrieval boundary enforcement.

### Coordinator Decomposition

| ID | Task | Branch | Status | Owner | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ASOLV-10A | Provider orchestration core | `feat/ai-solver-provider-orchestration` | ✅ Done | worker-provider | Commit `84295fd2`; added server-only OpenRouter orchestration, decomposition, multimodal message construction, safe provider errors. |
| ASOLV-10B | Session, image context, and threaded message store | `feat/ai-solver-threaded-store` | ✅ Done | worker-store | Commit `7c39cb72`; added owner-scoped image context, analysis persistence, threaded message helpers. |
| ASOLV-10C | Analyze and follow-up API routes | `feat/ai-solver-api-routes` | ✅ Done | worker-api | Commit `b0c826fb`; wired analyze/follow-up routes, persisted results, normalized errors, preserved retrieval boundaries. |
| ASOLV-10D | AI Solver UI result, selection Q&A, and thread panel | `feat/ai-solver-threaded-ui` | ✅ Done | worker-ui | Commit `651f948f`; built compact threaded AI Solver UI using local `design/` image style reference only, no Figma lookup. |
| ASOLV-10E | Backend/security and UI verification evidence | `feat/ai-solver-verification` | ✅ Done | coordinator | Commits `165f3228`, `70eb116c`, `51626eb3`, `3c9695de`, `1d19a9f4`; integrated API/UI, fixed UI contract, removed provider env names from fallback text, recorded harness evidence, switched to approved Gemini 3.1 model. |

### Shared Constraints for Workers

- Do not treat AI Solver as a generic chatbot; every provider call must stay bound to one owned AI Solver session, confirmed standard answer, uploaded materials, and structured analysis state.
- Similar problems and related articles must remain `not_connected` with empty records unless real retrieval is implemented.
- Do not log `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, image data URLs, raw provider payloads, or raw provider errors.
- No public registration, no student public Problem Bank mutation, no automatic Personal Library creation from follow-ups.

### Verification Notes

- `feature/openrouter-gemini-multimodal` fast-forwarded to integrated commit `1d19a9f4`.
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: passed in `.worktrees/ai-solver-verification`.
- `npm run lint`: passed in `.worktrees/ai-solver-verification`.
- `git diff --check`: passed in `.worktrees/ai-solver-verification`.
- `npm run build`: blocked by existing Next 16 Turbopack worktree root inference issue.
- `npx next build --webpack`: passed in `.worktrees/ai-solver-verification`.
- OpenRouter model availability check on 2026-05-09: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` did not list `google/gemini-3-pro-preview`; it did list `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview`. Product owner approved `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, and the server default now uses that model id.
- Security review: no OpenRouter key/client exposure found; image data URLs remain server/local-store only; owner-scoped local-store helpers gate sessions/uploads/messages; remaining medium risk is lack of rate/usage limiting for multi-call provider flows.
